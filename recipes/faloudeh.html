    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Faloudeh is an ancient Persian dessert, a sort of granita threaded with rice noodles and spiked with rosewater and lime. It is a refreshing and bright end to a rich meal filled with complex flavours.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li> 
        <li>fine sea salt</li>
        <li>⅓ cup lime juice, plus wedges, for serving (about 3 to 4 limes)</li>  
        <li>1½ tbsp rosewater</li>
        <li>110g very thin rice noodles or rice vermicelli</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place half a cup of water in a small saucepan and set over low heat. Add about half the sugar and stir to dissolve completely. Add one-eighth teaspoon salt and the rest of the sugar and continue stirring until completely dissolved. Take off the heat and let cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>In a freezer-safe bowl or dish, stir together one litre of water, cooled syrup, lime juice and rosewater, then place in freezer until ice crystals begin to form on the edges of the mixture, about one hour.</li>
        <li>In a medium pot, bring four litres of water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook thoroughly until there is no bite left, about eight minutes or as instructed on the package. Drain and rinse immediately with cold water. Use scissors to cut noodles into 2.5cm pieces, then stir them into the partly frozen syrup mixture. It's important that the mixture has begun to freeze before adding the noodles so that they don't all sink to the bottom of the dish, so if your syrup mixture needs more time, freeze for another hour before adding noodles.</li>
        <li>Every hour for the next several hours, scrape the granita thoroughly with a fork to prevent huge icy chunks from forming. The mixture should be light and airy, punctuated with crunchy noodles.</li>
        <li>To serve, scrape and serve bowlfuls of faloodeh with lime wedges.</li>
    </ol>
